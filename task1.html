    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a combination
        of Hypertext and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup defines the text
        document within tags to structure the web pages. This language annotates text so that machines can understand
        and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done
        on the text

    <h1>GIT</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among
        multiple people. Git is a Distributed Version Control System. So Git does not necessarily rely on a central
        server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a
        collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the
        metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting
        service like GitHub.

    <h1>
        NODEJS
    </h1>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source server environment that uses JavaScript on the server. A Node.js application runs
        within a single process, without generating a new thread for each request. Node.js includes asynchronous I/O
        primitives as a part of its standard library, which prevents JavaScript code from blocking and, in general,
        libraries in Node.js are developed using non-blocking paradigms. This makes blocking behaviour the exception
        instead of the rule.
